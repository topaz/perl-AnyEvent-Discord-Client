=head1 NAME

AnyEvent::Discord::Client - A Discord client library for the AnyEvent framework.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use AnyEvent::Discord::Client;

    my $token = 'NjI5NTQ4Mjg3NTMxMjg2......';
    
    my $bot = new AnyEvent::Discord::Client(
      token => $token,
      commands => {
        'commands' => sub {
          my ($bot, $args, $msg, $channel, $guild) = @_;
          $bot->say($channel->{id}, join("   ", map {"`$_`"} sort grep {!$commands_hidden{$_}} keys %{$bot->commands}));
        },
      },
    );
    
    $bot->add_commands(
      'hello' => sub {
        my ($bot, $args, $msg, $channel, $guild) = @_;
    
        $bot->say($channel->{id}, "hi, $msg->{author}{username}!");
      },
    );
    
    $bot->connect();
    AnyEvent->condvar->recv;

After adding this bot to a channel in a Discord Guild, type '!hello' in chat to run the example command.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides the functionality required to create a simple Discord
client or bot using the REST and WebSocket interfaces to Discord.

=head1 CONSTRUCTION

=over

=item C<< AnyEvent::Discord::Client->new(I<%opts>) >>

    AnyEvent::Discord::Client->new(token => $token)

Creates a new C<AnyEvent::Discord::Client> with the given configuration.
Takes the following parameters:

=over

=item C<token>

A Discord Bot token as given by the "Bot" section of a L<Discord Developer Portal application|https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/>. Required.

=item C<api_root>

The Discord API root to use. Default C<https://discordapp.com/api>.

=item C<prefix>

The command prefix to use when looking for registered commands in chat. Default C<!>.

=item C<commands>

A hashref of commands to begin with as if the hash were passed to C<register_commands()>.

=back

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item C<commands()>

Returns a hashref of the currently registered commands.

=item C<user()>

Returns a hashref representing a L<Discord User object|https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/resources/user> for the currently logged-in user.

=item C<guilds()>

Returns a hashref of guild IDs to hashrefs representing L<Discord Guild objects|https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/resources/guild> for any Guilds the client has seen.

=item C<channels()>

Returns a hashref of channel IDs to hashrefs representing L<Discord Channel objects|https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/resources/channel> for any Channels the client has seen.

=item C<roles()>

Returns a hashref of role IDs to hashrefs representing L<Discord Role objects|https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/permissions#role-object> for any Roles the client has seen.

=item C<connect()>

Causes the client to connect to Discord.  Will automatically attempt to reconnect if disconnected.  Returns nothing and immediately; to wait forever and prevent the program from exiting, follow this call with:

    AnyEvent->condvar->recv;

=item C<say(I<$channel_id>, I<$message>)>

Sends the given C<$message> text to the given C<$channel_id>.

=item C<typing(I<$channel>)>

Displays a typing indicator in the given channel.  Discord automatically removes the indicator after a few seconds; to keep it longer, this method returns an L<AnyEvent watcher|https://metacpan.org/pod/AnyEvent#WATCHERS> that you can keep in scope until you're done with your operation, then set it to C<undef> after.  For example:

    my $typing_watcher = $bot->typing($channel);
    
    # Now, do a potentially very slow operation, like calling an API.
    
    # Once the API responds, even asynchronously, disable the watcher:
    undef $typing_watcher;

=item C<add_commands(I<%commands>)>

Installs new commands - chat messages that begin with the C<prefix> given during construction and any key from the given hash.  When seen as a chat message, the corresponding subref of the registered command will be invoked.  The subref is passed a reference to the C<AnyEvent::Discord::Client> object, the text after the command, and hashrefs representing the relevant Discord L<Message|https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/resources/channel#message-object>, L<Channel|https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/resources/channel>, and L<Guild|https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/resources/guild> objects.  For example:

    $bot->add_commands(
      # register "!hello" command
      'hello' => sub {
        my ($bot, $args, $msg, $channel, $guild) = @_;
    
        $bot->say($channel->{id}, "hi, $msg->{author}{username}!");
      },
    );

=item C<api(I<$method>, I<$path>, I<$data>, I<$cb>)>

Invokes the Discord API asynchronously and returns immediately.  C<$method> is the HTTP method to use; C<$path> is the endpoint to call.  If C<$data> is a reference, it is sent as JSON; otherwise, if it is defined, it is sent as a C<x-www-form-urlencoded> body. Calls C<$cb> with C<undef> on failure. On success, calls C<$cb> with the decoded JSON result if the response type is C<application/json> or C<1> otherwise.

=item C<api_sync(I<$method>, I<$path>, I<$data>)>

Invokes the Discord API synchronously and returns the result of the call.  C<$method> is the HTTP method to use; C<$path> is the endpoint to call.  If C<$data> is a reference, it is sent as JSON; otherwise, if it is defined, it is sent as a C<x-www-form-urlencoded> body. Returns C<undef> on failure. On success, returns the decoded JSON result if the response type is C<application/json> or C<1> otherwise.

=item C<websocket_send(I<$op>, I<$d>)>

Sends a raw WebSocket payload as per the L<Discord Gateway|https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway> documentation.
